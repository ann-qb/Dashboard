> Authors: Ann Susan, Thejus S

## Technology used

## About the app
  * A dashboard application made using React. Within the app, there are two main roles, an admin and users. 
  * Users can have multiple roles.
  * The admin is set by default in the database and once logged in, he/she has the ability to see and edit all user details. Moreover only admin has the power to add a new user to the app.
  * Once the admin adds a user, the new user can use the registered email id to login to the app.
  * First login will prompt a create password field where the new user will set his/her password for the app. This password will be used for future logins.
  * Logged in user will be able to see all users including themselves, but can only edit the details of one's own profile.
